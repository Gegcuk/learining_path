# My Software Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal roadmap for mastering software development—a journey built on curiosity, discipline, and a passion for continuous growth. This repository is a carefully structured learning path, enhanced with carefully selected courses and real-world projects to reinforce each phase of study.

From establishing a solid foundation in core Java to navigating build tools, databases, microservices, and cloud-native ecosystems—here's my structured plan.

Happy learning and coding!
