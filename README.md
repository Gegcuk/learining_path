# üõ§Ô∏è My Software Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal roadmap for mastering software development‚Äîa journey built on curiosity, discipline, and a passion for continuous growth. This repository is a carefully structured learning path, enhanced with selected courses and real-world projects to reinforce each phase of study.

From establishing a solid foundation in core Java to navigating build tools, databases, microservices, GraphQL, and cloud-native ecosystems‚Äîhere‚Äôs my structured plan.

## üìù Learning Tactics

I employ self-devised strategies to enhance my learning, grounded in recent research. For every chapter I read, I create detailed tests that include:

- Open-ended questions  
- Multiple-choice questions  
- Fill-in-the-blank exercises  
- Architecture and practical application questions  

This approach reinforces my understanding and ensures I can apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.
