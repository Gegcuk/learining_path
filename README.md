# My Software Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal roadmap for mastering software development — a journey built on curiosity, discipline, and a passion for continuous growth. This repository is not just a list of books and resources; it's a carefully structured learning path designed to transform challenges into stepping stones toward expertise.

From establishing a solid foundation in core Java to navigating the worlds of build tools, databases (both SQL and NoSQL), and full‑stack ecosystems.
